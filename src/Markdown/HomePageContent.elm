[RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/), [RDF-STAR](https://www.w3.org/2021/12/rdf-star.html), 
[SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/), 
and [SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/).

Our passion is in solving hard problems that require:

* Advanced data modeling for reusable component ontologies and support for aspects/traits
* Functional programming idioms
* Commodity tools and libraries
* Modern software engineering practices for:
  * Rapid iteration, 
  * Test-driven development,
  * High quality APIs,
  * Continuous Integration and Deployment

**InteroptX** builds computing frameworks, libraries and automation for data harmonization, 
aggregation and transformations.

Knowledge graphs are based on semantic technology standards.

Modern software engineering approaches are based on Functional Programming.
Together they achieve high quality, high performance and scalable transformations.

Applications that use knowledge graphs are hard to build.
First there are key practices to be adopted in the making and deployment of knowledge graphs.
Second making user interfaces based on semantic technologies is a new and demanding job.
Third scalability of data, of the user experience, and the developer experience are challenges.

**InteroptX's** reason for being is to provide consulting and assets for addressing these challenges.
