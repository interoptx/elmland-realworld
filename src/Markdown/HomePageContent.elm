**InteroptX** exists to help companies build modern applications that use knowledge graphs based on W3C technologies.

Applications that use knowledge graphs are hard to build.
First there are key practices to be adopted in the making and deployment of knowledge graphs.
Second making user interfaces based on semantic technologies is a new and demanding job.
Third scalability of data, of the user experience, and the developer experience are challenges.

Our interest is in solving hard problems that require knowledge of:

* Advanced data modeling using [SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/) for Component Ontologies 
* Functional programming idioms
* Commodity tools and libraries
* Modern software engineering practices for:
  * Rapid iteration, 
  * Test-driven development,
  * High quality APIs,
  * Continuous Integration and Deployment

InteroptX's reason for being is to provide consulting and assets for addressing these challenges.
